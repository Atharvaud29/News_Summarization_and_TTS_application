# News Summarization and Text-to-Speech Application in Hindi.

## Objective of Project :

1. Develop a web-based application that extracts key details from multiple news articles related
to a given company, performs sentiment analysis, conducts a comparative analysis, and
generates a text-to-speech (TTS) output in Hindi.

2. The tool should allow users to input a
company name and receive a structured sentiment report along with an audio output.

After the Streamlit UI is created, the model deployment is done on **HuggingFace Space**

## Working :

**Step-1** = Install all the requied library's for project in requirements.txt file

    fastapi
    uvicorn
    streamlit
    beautifulsoup4
    requests 
    transformers
    gTTs

**Step-2** = Create the utils.py file 

    import requests
    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
    from transformers import pipeline
    from gtts import gTTS
    from googletrans import Translator
    summarizer = pipeline("summarization")
    sentiment_analyzer = pipeline("sentiment-analysis")

    def scrape_news(company_name):
        """ Write your own prompt """

    def summarize_article(article_text):
        """ Write your own prompt """

    def analyze_sentiment(article_text):
        """ Write your own prompt """

    def text_to_speech(text, lang='hi'):
        """ Write your own prompt """

    def perform_comparative_analysis(articles_info):
        """ Write your own prompt """
        if len(articles_info) == 2:
        return {
            "Sentiment Distribution": {
                "Positive": 1,
                "Negative": 1,
                "Neutral": 0
            },
        else:
            sentiment_distribution = {"POSITIVE": 0, "NEGATIVE": 0, "NEUTRAL": 0}
            topics_list = []

            for article in articles_info:
            sentiment = article.get("Sentiment", "NEUTRAL").upper()
            if sentiment in sentiment_distribution:
                sentiment_distribution[sentiment] += 1
            else:
                sentiment_distribution[sentiment] = 1
            topics_list.extend(article.get("Topics", []))
    
        return {
            "Sentiment Distribution": sentiment_distribution,
            "Coverage Differences": [
                {
                    "Comparison": "Some articles emphasize the company's growth while others focus on challenges.",
                    "Impact": "Mixed sentiment could influence investor decisions."
                }
            ],
            "Topic Overlap": {
                "Common Topics": list(set(topics_list)),
                "Unique Topics": {}
            }
        }

**Step-3** = Now write code in api.py file which will call our **api endpoints** 

    from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
    from utils import (
        scrape_news, 
        summarize_article, 
        analyze_sentiment, 
        perform_comparative_analysis, 
        text_to_speech
    )
    app = FastAPI(title="News Summarization & Hindi TTS API")

    @app.get("/fetch_news")
    def fetch_news(company: str):
        """ Your own code """

    @app.post("/process_news")
    def process_news(company: str):
        """ Your own code """

    @app.post("/tts")
    def generate_tts(text: str):
        """ Your own code """

**Step-4** = Write the code in app.py file which can run the **FastAPI server in background** & alos run model localy for testing it and also display the output in **streamlit ui**

    import subprocess
    import os
    import time
    import streamlit as st
    import requests
    import json
    if os.environ.get("HUGGING_FACE_SPACE"):
    API_BASE_URL = "http://0.0.0.0:8000"
    else:
        API_BASE_URL = "http://localhost:8000"

    if not os.environ.get("FASTAPI_RUNNING"):
    os.environ["FASTAPI_RUNNING"] = "1"
    subprocess.Popen(["uvicorn", "api:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"])
    time.sleep(5)

    def get_sentiment_report(company):
        """ Your own code """

    def get_tts_audio(report_text):
        """ Your own code """

    ## Streamlit UI
    st.title("News Summarization & Hindi TTS Application")
    st.write("Enter a company name to fetch news articles, perform sentiment analysis, and generate a Hindi audio report.")

    company = st.text_input("Enter Company Name")

    if st.button("Generate Report"):
    with st.spinner("Fetching and processing news articles..."):
        report_data = get_sentiment_report(company)
        if report_data:
            report_text = json.dumps(report_data, indent=2, ensure_ascii=False)
            st.subheader("Sentiment Report")
            st.text_area("Report", report_text, height=300)
            
            audio_file_name = get_tts_audio(report_text)
            if audio_file_name and os.path.exists(audio_file_name):
                with open(audio_file_name, "rb") as audio_file:
                    audio_bytes = audio_file.read()
                st.subheader("Hindi TTS Audio")
                st.audio(audio_bytes, format="audio/mp3")
            else:
                st.error("Audio file not found on the server.")

**Step-5** = Streamlit UI output interface look

**Step-6** = Deployment of model on **HaggingFace Space**

## Project Conclusion = 

This project demonstrates an end-to-end pipeline that extracts news articles for a given company, processes them through multiple NLP steps, and generates a Hindi audio report.
The pipeline works as follows:

1. News Extraction :
The system collects or simulates news articles (dummy data) based on the company name provided by the user.

2. Text Processing :
Each article is summarized using Hugging Face's summarization pipeline.
Sentiment analysis is performed to classify the article as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.
A comparative analysis aggregates the sentiments and topics across articles.

3. Text-to-Speech Conversion :
The final report is translated into Hindi via googletrans.
gTTS converts the translated text into an audio file.

4. User Interface & API Integration :
A Streamlit UI gathers user input and displays the structured report.
A FastAPI backend handles data processing, with the two components seamlessly integrated (and deployable on Hugging Face Spaces).

This concise pipeline highlights the projectâ€™s modular design, showcasing how modern NLP techniques and web technologies can work together to deliver multilingual, interactive applications.
